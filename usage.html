<p>
  First make sure you have Eerie installed, if not, the check out the <a href="index.html#install">introductory page</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
  If you don't want Eerie to touch your shell's start up script, just don't pass
  path to it when running <code>setup.io</code>, you will get a short instructions
  which environment varables need to be set and to which values.
</p>

<p>
  Now try running <code>eerie</code> command, if it complains about no given tasks it - don't worry, we'll give it a headache soon!
</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>
  Before we dive into <code>eerie</code> command, we should understand how Eerie actually works.
</p>
<p>
  Just like <a href="http://hellorip.com">Rip</a>,
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> and <a href="http://jdp.github.com/boid">Boid</a>,
  Eerie uses the concept of multiple environments which can keep completely different packages (including different versions).
  You can for example create a new environment for every application you have together with its dependencies.
</p>
<p class="note">
  To change environment within your application you can use this:<br/>
  <code>Eerie Env named("superSecretApp") use</code>
</p>
<p>
  An active environment is the one which is used by default from Io code and
  whose executable files you can run from command line.
  During the install Eerie creates two environments <code>_base</code> and <code>default</code>.
  The <code>_base</code> environment will be loaded always as it contains Eerie itself (with its dependencies).
  Installing packages into <code>_base</code> environment should be considered dangerous as it was reported that it steals muffins.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Due to the fact that Eerie has its own environment, it's the only package which can't have multiple versions installed.
  <small>(Actually you can even do that, but the version installed in <code>_base</code> environment
    will be always loaded first, unless you edit <code>~/.iorc</code>, of course.)</small>
</p>
<p>
  The other environment created during install, <code>default</code>, on the other hand, can be freely tampered with.
</p>
<p>
  Now when we have absorbed basic concepts we shall dive into the actual command itself.
</p>

<a name="command"></a>
<h2>Command line tool</h2>
<p>
  As we noted before, during the install Eerie made a small change to your bash script - you can now call command-line tools written in Io with ease.
  Eerie, logically, installs the <code>eerie</code> command with which you can install new packages, manipulate environments and make sandwiches for dinner.
</p>
<p>
  Now let us begin with this simple command:
</p>
<pre><code>$ eerie -T
$ ...
</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, there's nothing revolutionary going on, it just prints all the commands it knows together with their short descriptions.
  Now we shall create an environment in which we will develop our next super-cool web app.
  To do that, we'll need:
  <ol>
    <li>New environment,</li>
    <li>Super awesome web framework,</li>
    <li>Io templating support,</li>
    <li>Secret ingredients which will make our web app even more awesome.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<pre><code>$ eerie env:create webapp
...
$ eerie env:activate webapp
...
$ eerie install git://github.com/josip/generys
...
$ eerie install git://github.com/stygstra/Io-Templating.git
...
$ generys create super-secret-app/
...
</code></pre>
