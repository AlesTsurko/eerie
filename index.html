<a name="about"></a>
<h2>What did you say Eerie is for?</h2>
<p>Using external libraries (or addons, if you insist) in Io isn't exactly fabulous,
not to mention the case when addons have some C code.</p>
<p>Eerie brings to Io what other languages have enjoyed for a long time:
simplicity of using other people's code in your own projects as well as splitting
your own code into smaller parts.</p>
