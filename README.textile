h1. Eerie, package manager for Io

Eerie is an attempt to create feature-full package manager for Io, due to lack of working and usable package managers.
Eerie is modelled after "Rip":http://hellorip.com which means that there is no central repository of packages, and that environments
are used as a tool for switching between different versions.

h2. How to install

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/josip/eerie.git
$ cd eerie
$ io setup.io
# Close current terminal session and start a new one or reload your profile
$ . ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

Eerie currently ships with a simple <code>eerie</code> command which can do all sorts exciting of things!

<code>$ eerie install git://github.com/josip/generys.git</code>

That will, for example, install the Generys package! How exciting!
For a complete guide on installing and using Eerie check out its "web site":http://josip.github.com/eerie.
