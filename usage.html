<p>
  First make sure you have Eerie installed, if not, the check out the <a href="index.html#install">introductory page</a>.
  To be able to use <code>eerie</code> command you have to either start a new terminal session or simply reload your bash profile:
</p>

<pre><code>$ . ~/.bash_profile</code></pre>

<p class="note">
  Not all operating systems sotre bash profile in the same file, OS X keeps it in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>,
  while some Linux it can be distributions in <code>~/.bashrc</code>, or <code>~/.profile</code> file. Make sure you
  reload the right one.
</p>

<p>
  Now try running <code>eerie</code> command, if it prints nothing it means you successfully installed it! Bravo!

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>
  Before we dive into <code>eerie</code> command, we should understand how Eerie actually works.
</p>
<p>
  Just like <a href="http://hellorip.com">Rip</a>,
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a> and <a href="http://jdp.github.com/boid">Boid</a>,
  Eerie uses the concept of multiple environments which can keep completely different packages (including different versions).
  Every application can have its own environment with all required dependencies.
</p>
<p class="note">
  To change environment within your application you can use this:<br/>
  <code>Eerie Env named("superSecretApp") use</code>
</p>
<p>
  An active environment is the one which is used by default from Io code and
  whose executable files you can run from command line.
  During the install Eerie creates two environments <code>_base</code> and <code>default</code>.
  The <code>_base</code> environment will be loaded always as it contains Eerie itself (with its dependencies).
  Installing packages into <code>_base</code> environment should be considered dangerous as it was reported that it eats little children for breakfast.
</p>
<p class="note">
  Due to the fact that Eerie has its own environment, it's the only package which can't have multiple versions installed. 
</p>
<p>
  The other environment created during install, <code>default</code>, on the other hand, can be freely tampered with.
