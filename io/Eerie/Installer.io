    /*doc Installer build(Package) Compiles the `Package` if it has
    native code. Returns `true` if the package was compiled and `false`
    otherwise. Note, the return value doesn't mean whether the compilation was
    successful or not, it's just about whether it's went through the compilation
    process.

    To customize compilation you can modify `build.io` file at the root of your
    package. This file is evaluated in the context of `Builder` so you can treat
    it as an ancestor of `Builder`. If you want to link a library `foobar`, for
    example, your `build.io` file would look like:

    ```Io
    dependsOnLib("foobar")
    ```

    Look `Builder`'s documentation for more methods you can use in `build.io`.
